# Feedback Systems in RAG

Feedback systems allow RAG applications to improve over time by learning from user interactions and preferences.

## Types of Feedback

### Explicit Feedback
- Thumbs up/down ratings
- Relevance scores (1-5 stars)
- Binary helpful/not helpful

### Implicit Feedback
- Click-through rates
- Time spent reading
- Follow-up questions

## Implementation Strategies

### Online Learning
Real-time updates to ranking models based on feedback:
- Immediate score adjustments
- Gradient-based updates
- Reinforcement learning approaches

### Batch Processing
Periodic model retraining:
- Collect feedback over time
- Retrain ranking models
- A/B testing for improvements

## Feedback Integration

### Document Scoring
Adjust document relevance scores based on historical feedback for similar queries.

### Re-ranking Models
Train specialized models to reorder search results using feedback signals.

### Query Understanding
Use feedback to improve query interpretation and expansion.

## Challenges
- Cold start problem for new documents
- Feedback sparsity
- Bias in user feedback
- Balancing exploration vs exploitation
