# Introduction to RAG Systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines information retrieval with large language models to provide accurate, contextual responses based on external knowledge sources.

## Key Components

### Document Storage
RAG systems typically store documents in a searchable format, often using vector embeddings to capture semantic meaning.

### Retrieval Process
When a user asks a question, the system:
1. Converts the query to embeddings
2. Searches for relevant documents
3. Ranks results by relevance

### Generation
The retrieved documents are then used as context for a language model to generate a comprehensive answer.

## Benefits
- Access to up-to-date information
- Reduced hallucinations
- Traceable sources
- Domain-specific knowledge integration
