# API Design for RAG Systems

Well-designed APIs are crucial for RAG systems to provide reliable, scalable, and user-friendly interfaces.

## Core Endpoints

### Query Endpoint: POST /ask
Primary interface for asking questions:
```json
{
  "query": "What is vector similarity search?",
  "max_results": 5,
  "include_sources": true
}
```

Response includes:
- Generated answer
- Source documents with citations
- Confidence scores
- Performance metrics

### Feedback Endpoint: POST /feedback
Collect user feedback for continuous improvement:
```json
{
  "query_id": "uuid-123",
  "document_id": "doc-456", 
  "feedback": "positive",
  "relevance_score": 4
}
```

### Metrics Endpoint: GET /metrics
Monitor system performance:
- Response latencies (p50, p95)
- Hit rates at different k values
- Token usage statistics
- User satisfaction scores

## Design Principles

### Consistency
- Standardized response formats
- Consistent error handling
- Predictable behavior

### Performance
- Async processing for long queries
- Caching for frequent requests
- Streaming for real-time updates

### Observability
- Request tracing
- Performance monitoring  
- Error logging and alerting
