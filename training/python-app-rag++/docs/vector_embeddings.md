# Vector Embeddings

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning in high-dimensional space.

## How They Work

Text is converted into dense vectors where similar concepts are positioned closer together in the vector space.

### Popular Models
- **Sentence-BERT**: Efficient for sentence-level embeddings
- **all-MiniLM-L6-v2**: Fast and lightweight model
- **text-embedding-ada-002**: OpenAI's embedding model

## Applications
Vector embeddings enable:
- Semantic search
- Document similarity
- Question answering
- Recommendation systems

## Storage Options
- FAISS: Facebook's similarity search library
- Chroma: Open-source embedding database
- Pinecone: Managed vector database service

## Best Practices
1. Choose appropriate model for your domain
2. Consider embedding dimensionality vs performance
3. Implement proper chunking strategies
4. Use hybrid search for better results
