# AI-Assisted Dev Starter (VS Code + Copilot)

A reusable toolkit of prompts, templates, and checklists to speed up the SDLC.

## Quick start
1. Install recommended extensions (VS Code prompts appear).
2. Skim `prompts/00_foundation/house-rules.md`.
3. Open Copilot Chat, run: “Apply the **house rules** to this repo”.
4. Start with `prompts/10_planning/user-stories.md` or `30_coding/implement-feature.md`.
5. Use `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` when raising PRs.

## Conventions
- Keep prompts short; provide context with file paths or `@workspace`.
- Prefer plans → small patches → tests → docs.
- Never paste secrets. Treat AI output like junior-dev code: review, test, scan.
