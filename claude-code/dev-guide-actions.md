# Software Development Startup Guide
## Getting Started with Claude Code & TDD

### üöÄ Day 1: Project Initialization

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Project Directory
```bash
# Create and navigate to your project directory
mkdir my-app
cd my-app

# Initialize version control
git init

# Create initial .gitignore
echo "node_modules/
*.pyc
__pycache__/
.coverage
.pytest_cache/
dist/
build/
*.egg-info/
.env" > .gitignore
```

#### Step 2: Create Your claude.md File
Create a file named `claude.md` in your project root with this initial template:


#### Step 3: Use Claude Code to Generate Project Structure
Run your first Claude Code command:
```bash
claude "Generate a project structure for my project with the following requirements:
- Testing setup
- Basic folder structure following best practices
- Configuration files for testing
- A simple README.md
- Package/dependency management setup"
```

claude -> `Update memory with current project folder structure`


---

### üß™ Day 2: Testing Framework Setup

#### Step 4: Configure Your Testing Environment

**For Python Projects:**
```bash
claude "Create a pytest configuration with:
- pytest.ini file
- Coverage settings targeting 80% minimum
- Test directory structure
- Conftest.py with basic fixtures
- Example test file"
```

**For JavaScript/Node.js Projects:**
```bash
claude "Create a Jest configuration with:
- jest.config.js
- Coverage thresholds at 80%
- Test directory structure
- Setup files for testing utilities
- Example test file"
```

---

### üèóÔ∏è Day 3: First Feature Development

Break down user stories into small steps

#### Step 5: Plan Your First Feature
Update your claude.md file:
```markdown
## Current Context
**Working on:** User Story #1 - [Description]
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3
**Next step:** Write E2E test for the feature
```

### üîÑ Ongoing Development Workflow

#### Daily Development Cycle

**Morning Setup (5 minutes):**
1. Update claude.md with current context
2. Review yesterday's progress
3. Plan today's tasks

**Development Loop (per feature):**
```bash
# 1. Write the test
claude "Write a test for [specific behavior]"

# 2. Run and watch it fail
[test command]

# 3. Implement minimal solution
claude "Implement code to pass this test: [test code]"

# 4. Run tests again
[test command]

# 5. Refactor if needed
claude "Refactor this code for better [performance/readability]: [code]"

# 6. Commit when green
git add . && git commit -m "type: description"
```

**End of Day (10 minutes):**
1. Run full test suite
2. Update claude.md with progress
3. Document any decisions or patterns discovered
4. Push to remote repository

### üõ†Ô∏è Essential Claude Code Commands

#### Testing Commands
```bash
# Generate comprehensive test cases
claude "Generate edge case tests for [function/component]"

# Create test fixtures
claude "Create test fixtures for [data structure/model]"

# Analyze test coverage
claude "What test cases are missing for this code: [code]"
```

#### Development Commands
```bash
# Code generation with tests
claude "Create a [component] with corresponding unit tests"

# Refactoring
claude "Refactor this code using [pattern]: [code]"

# Code review
claude "Review this code for issues and improvements: [code]"

claude "Develop a following user story with minimal unit tests: "
```

#### Documentation Commands
```bash
# Generate documentation
claude "Generate documentation for this module: [code]"

# Create examples
claude "Create usage examples for this API: [code]"
```

### üìä Progress Tracking

#### Weekly Metrics to Track
- [ ] Test coverage percentage
- [ ] Number of tests (unit/integration/e2e)
- [ ] Features completed
- [ ] Technical debt items identified
- [ ] Refactoring completed

#### Update claude.md Weekly With:
```markdown
## Week [N] Summary
**Completed:**
- Feature X with N tests
- Refactored Y component
- Coverage: XX%

**Learned:**
- [Key learning or pattern discovered]

**Next Week Focus:**
- [Primary goal]
```

### üö® Quick Troubleshooting

#### Problem: Tests are slow
```bash
claude "Optimize these slow tests using mocks: [test code]"
```

#### Problem: Unclear how to test something
```bash
claude "What's the best testing strategy for [complex scenario]?"
```

#### Problem: Too much test duplication
```bash
claude "Create test helpers to reduce duplication in: [test files]"
```

#### Problem: Lost context in Claude Code
```bash
# Provide context from claude.md
claude "Given this project context: [paste relevant sections from claude.md], help me with [specific task]"
```

#### Problem: Outdated CLAUDE.md
```bash
claude "Update @CLAUDE.md with current project folder structure"
```

# Flow

`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`

Run your first Claude Code command:
```bash
claude "Generate a project structure for my project using CLAUDE.md information with the following requirements:
- Testing setup
- Basic folder structure following best practices
- Configuration files for testing
- A simple README.md
- Package/dependency management setup"
```

- Check installation
`npm install`, `npm run dev'

- Update CLAUDE.md
```bash
claude "Update @CLAUDE.md with current project folder structure"
```

Implementation flow:
```bash
claude "Develop a part of this user story: [story] with corresponding unit tests: [part]"
```
```bash
claude "Develop a next part of current user story with corresponding minimal unit tests: [part]"
```

Develop a part of this user story: [By clicking the Generate password button, the user can see a password being generated] with corresponding minimal unit tests: [Add a "Generate password" button to the UI.]

Develop a next part of current user story with corresponding minimal unit tests: [Set default length (e.g., 12) and enforce minimum/maximum limits (e.g., 8-50).]
