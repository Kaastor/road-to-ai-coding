# Software Development Startup Guide
## Getting Started with Claude Code & TDD

### 🚀 Day 1: Project Initialization

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Project Directory
```bash
# Create and navigate to your project directory
mkdir my-app
cd my-app

# Initialize version control
git init

# Create initial .gitignore
echo "node_modules/
*.pyc
__pycache__/
.coverage
.pytest_cache/
dist/
build/
*.egg-info/
.env" > .gitignore
```

#### Step 2: Create Your claude.md File
Create a file named `claude.md` in your project root with this initial template:

```markdown
# Project: [Your App Name]
## Last Updated: [Today's Date]

## Overview
[Write a 2-3 sentence description of what your app will do]

## Technical Stack
- Language: [e.g., Python 3.11, Node.js 20]
- Framework: [e.g., FastAPI, Express, React]
- Testing: [e.g., pytest, Jest, React Testing Library]
- Database: [if applicable]

## Features (Prioritized)
### Must Have (MVP)
1. [ ] Feature 1
2. [ ] Feature 2
3. [ ] Feature 3

### Should Have
1. [ ] Feature 4
2. [ ] Feature 5

### Nice to Have
1. [ ] Feature 6

## Current Context
**Working on:** Initial project setup
**Next step:** Set up testing framework
**Blockers:** None

## Architecture Decisions
- [Record key decisions here]

## Code Patterns
- [Document patterns as you establish them]

## Test Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user paths
```

#### Step 3: Use Claude Code to Generate Project Structure
Run your first Claude Code command:
```bash
claude "Generate a project structure for [your language/framework] with the following requirements:
- TDD setup with [testing framework]
- Basic folder structure following best practices
- Configuration files for testing and linting
- A simple README.md
- Package/dependency management setup"
```

### 📋 Day 1 Checklist
- [ ] Project directory created
- [ ] Git initialized
- [ ] claude.md file created and filled out
- [ ] Basic project structure generated
- [ ] Dependencies installed

---

### 🧪 Day 2: Testing Framework Setup

#### Step 4: Configure Your Testing Environment

**For Python Projects:**
```bash
claude "Create a pytest configuration with:
- pytest.ini file
- Coverage settings targeting 80% minimum
- Test directory structure
- Conftest.py with basic fixtures
- Example test file"
```

**For JavaScript/Node.js Projects:**
```bash
claude "Create a Jest configuration with:
- jest.config.js
- Coverage thresholds at 80%
- Test directory structure
- Setup files for testing utilities
- Example test file"
```

#### Step 5: Write Your First Test
Create your first failing test to establish the TDD workflow:

```bash
claude "Write a failing test for a simple [describe your first feature, e.g., 'user registration validation function']"
```

#### Step 6: Run the Test to Ensure It Fails
```bash
# For Python
pytest tests/ -v

# For JavaScript
npm test

# The test SHOULD fail - this is the "Red" phase of TDD
```

#### Step 7: Implement Minimal Code to Pass
```bash
claude "Write the minimal implementation to make this test pass: [paste your failing test]"
```

### 📋 Day 2 Checklist
- [ ] Testing framework configured
- [ ] Coverage settings established
- [ ] First failing test written
- [ ] Test confirmed to fail
- [ ] Minimal implementation created
- [ ] Test now passes (Green phase)

### 🏗️ Day 3: First Feature Development

#### Step 8: Plan Your First Feature
Update your claude.md file:
```markdown
## Current Context
**Working on:** User Story #1 - [Description]
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3
**Next step:** Write E2E test for the feature
```

#### Step 9: Write End-to-End Test
```bash
claude "Write an end-to-end test for this user story: [paste your user story and acceptance criteria]"
```

#### Step 10: Break Down into Unit Tests
```bash
claude "Based on this E2E test, identify the components needed and generate unit tests for each: [paste E2E test]"
```

#### Step 11: Implement Feature Incrementally
For each unit test:
1. Run test (Red)
2. Implement code (Green)
3. Refactor (Refactor)
4. Commit changes

```bash
# After each successful test
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement [specific functionality]"
```

### 📋 Day 3 Checklist
- [ ] First user story documented
- [ ] E2E test written (failing)
- [ ] Unit tests created
- [ ] Features implemented incrementally
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code committed to git

### 🔄 Ongoing Development Workflow

#### Daily Development Cycle

**Morning Setup (5 minutes):**
1. Update claude.md with current context
2. Review yesterday's progress
3. Plan today's tasks

**Development Loop (per feature):**
```bash
# 1. Write the test
claude "Write a test for [specific behavior]"

# 2. Run and watch it fail
[test command]

# 3. Implement minimal solution
claude "Implement code to pass this test: [test code]"

# 4. Run tests again
[test command]

# 5. Refactor if needed
claude "Refactor this code for better [performance/readability]: [code]"

# 6. Commit when green
git add . && git commit -m "type: description"
```

**End of Day (10 minutes):**
1. Run full test suite
2. Update claude.md with progress
3. Document any decisions or patterns discovered
4. Push to remote repository

### ✅ First Week Success Criteria

By the end of your first week, you should have:
1. ✅ Complete project setup with testing framework
2. ✅ At least 3 features implemented with TDD
3. ✅ >80% code coverage on business logic
4. ✅ Established coding patterns documented in claude.md
5. ✅ Clean git history with meaningful commits
6. ✅ A rhythm for the TDD cycle

### 📚 Additional Resources

#### Learn More About TDD
- Practice the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Start with simple functions before complex features
- Write tests that describe behavior, not implementation

#### Maximize Claude Code Efficiency
- Be specific in your requests
- Provide context from your claude.md file
- Ask for multiple approaches when unsure
- Request explanations with code

#### Keep Your Momentum
- Commit working code frequently
- Celebrate small wins (passing tests!)
- Review and refactor regularly
- Keep claude.md updated daily

## Your Next Action

**Right now, do this:**
1. Create your project directory
2. Copy the claude.md template above
3. Fill in your project details
4. Run your first Claude Code command to generate the project structure
5. Commit your initial setup

Remember: The key to success with TDD is consistency. Every feature starts with a test. No exceptions!

Good luck with your development journey! 🚀
