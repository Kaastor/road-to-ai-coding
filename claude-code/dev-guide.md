# Comprehensive Guide: Building Apps with Claude Code and TDD

## 1. Overall Development Strategy

**Key Principles and Approaches:**
- **Test-First Development**: Every feature begins with a failing test that defines expected behavior
- **Incremental Progress**: Build the app in small, testable units that can be validated independently
- **Continuous Refactoring**: Improve code structure after each green test while maintaining functionality
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation in claude.md for consistent AI assistance
- **Iterative Enhancement**: Start with minimal viable features and enhance through controlled iterations

## 2. Planning Stage

### 2.1 Initialize Project Foundation
1. Create a new project directory with Claude Code
2. Set up version control (git init)
3. Initialize claude.md with project template:
   ```
   # Project: [App Name]
   ## Overview
   [Brief description]

   ## Technical Stack
   - Language: [e.g., Python, JavaScript]
   - Framework: [if applicable]
   - Testing: [e.g., pytest, Jest]

   ## Features
   [List of planned features]

   ## Current Context
   [What's being worked on]
   ```

### 2.2 Define Requirements
1. Break down the app into user stories
   - Write each story in the format: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
   - Add acceptance criteria for each story
2. Prioritize features using MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
3. Document all requirements in claude.md under a "## Requirements" section

### 2.3 Design Application Architecture
1. Create a high-level system diagram
   - Use Claude Code to generate PlantUML or Mermaid diagrams
   - Command: `claude "Generate a system architecture diagram for [describe app]"`
2. Define core components and their relationships
3. Establish naming conventions and project structure
4. Document architectural decisions in claude.md

### 2.4 Set Up Development Environment
1. Use Claude Code to generate project scaffolding:
   ```
   claude "Create a project structure for [language/framework] with TDD setup"
   ```
2. Install testing frameworks and dependencies
3. Configure test runners and coverage tools
4. Create initial CI/CD pipeline configuration

## 3. Development Stage

### 3.1 TDD Implementation Cycle
For each feature, follow this strict sequence:

1. **Write the Test First**
   ```
   claude "Write a failing test for [specific feature/behavior]"
   ```
   - Start with the simplest test case
   - Focus on one behavior at a time
   - Ensure the test fails for the right reason

2. **Implement Minimal Code**
   ```
   claude "Write the minimal code to make this test pass: [paste test]"
   ```
   - Write only enough code to pass the test
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Keep implementations simple

3. **Refactor with Confidence**
   ```
   claude "Refactor this code while keeping tests green: [paste code]"
   ```
   - Improve code structure and readability
   - Extract common patterns
   - Ensure all tests still pass

### 3.2 Feature Development Workflow
1. **Start with End-to-End Test**
   - Write acceptance test for the entire feature
   - This test will fail initially and guide development

2. **Decompose into Unit Tests**
   - Break down the feature into smaller units
   - Write unit tests for each component
   - Use Claude Code to generate test cases:
     ```
     claude "Generate comprehensive unit tests for [component/function]"
     ```

3. **Implement Incrementally**
   - Build each unit to pass its tests
   - Integrate units step by step
   - Run all tests after each integration

### 3.3 Tips for Efficient Claude Code Usage

**Code Generation:**
- Be specific about requirements: "Generate a REST API endpoint that validates email format and returns 400 for invalid emails"
- Request code with tests: "Create a function with corresponding unit tests for [functionality]"
- Ask for multiple implementations: "Show me 3 different ways to implement [feature]"

**Test Creation:**
- Generate edge cases: "What edge cases should I test for [function]?"
- Create test fixtures: "Generate test fixtures for [data structure]"
- Build test utilities: "Create a test helper function for [repeated test pattern]"

**Refactoring:**
- Pattern extraction: "Extract common patterns from these functions: [code]"
- Performance optimization: "Optimize this code while maintaining test coverage: [code]"
- Code review: "Review this code for potential issues: [code]"

## 4. Testing Stage

### 4.1 Test Pyramid Implementation
1. **Unit Tests (70% of tests)**
   - Test individual functions and methods
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Aim for 100% code coverage of business logic
   - Use Claude Code: `claude "Generate unit tests with mocks for [module]"`

2. **Integration Tests (20% of tests)**
   - Test component interactions
   - Verify data flow between modules
   - Test database operations and API calls
   - Command: `claude "Create integration tests for [component A] and [component B]"`

3. **End-to-End Tests (10% of tests)**
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Verify system behavior from user perspective
   - Focus on critical paths
   - Command: `claude "Write E2E test for user journey: [describe journey]"`

### 4.2 TDD Best Practices

**Writing Effective Tests:**
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- One assertion per test when possible
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior
- Keep tests independent and isolated

**Test Maintenance:**
- Refactor tests alongside production code
- Remove redundant tests after refactoring
- Update tests when requirements change
- Use Claude Code to identify test gaps:
  ```
  claude "Analyze this code for missing test cases: [code]"
  ```

**Continuous Testing:**
- Run tests before every commit
- Set up automated test runs on file changes
- Monitor test execution time and optimize slow tests
- Maintain test documentation in claude.md

## 5. Iteration and Refinement

### 5.1 Code Review Cycle
1. **Self-Review with Claude Code**
   ```
   claude "Review this code for best practices and potential issues: [code]"
   ```
2. **Test Coverage Analysis**
   ```
   claude "Identify untested code paths in: [code]"
   ```
3. **Performance Optimization**
   ```
   claude "Suggest performance improvements for: [code]"
   ```

### 5.2 Feature Enhancement Process
1. Update tests to reflect new requirements
2. Watch tests fail (Red phase)
3. Modify implementation (Green phase)
4. Refactor for clarity (Refactor phase)
5. Update documentation in claude.md

### 5.3 Technical Debt Management
1. **Identify Code Smells**
   - Use Claude Code to detect patterns that need refactoring
   - Command: `claude "Identify code smells and suggest refactoring: [code]"`

2. **Prioritize Refactoring**
   - Focus on high-impact, low-risk improvements
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage before major refactoring

3. **Document Decisions**
   - Record refactoring rationale in claude.md
   - Track technical debt items for future sprints
