Project Overview

  A lightweight ML Model Registry PoC for managing machine learning models, their
  metadata, versions, and lifecycle. This will be a REST API service that allows data
  scientists to register, discover, and manage ML models with proper versioning and
  metadata tracking.

‚óè Modular Implementation Plan

  Phase 1: Foundation & Core Domain (Iteration 1-2)

  Iteration 1: Project Setup & Domain Models
  - Set up project structure with Poetry
  - Define core domain models (Model, Version, Metadata)
  - Implement basic data validation
  - Add configuration management

  Iteration 2: Storage Layer
  - Implement repository pattern for data access
  - Create in-memory storage (SQLite for simplicity)
  - Add basic CRUD operations
  - Implement model serialization

  Phase 2: API Layer (Iteration 3-4)

  Iteration 3: REST API Foundation
  - Set up FastAPI with basic endpoints
  - Implement model registration endpoint
  - Add health check and basic error handling
  - Create API documentation with OpenAPI

  Iteration 4: Model Management APIs
  - Add model listing and search endpoints
  - Implement model versioning endpoints
  - Add metadata update capabilities
  - Include basic input validation

  Phase 3: File Storage & Model Artifacts (Iteration 5-6)

  Iteration 5: File Storage
  - Implement local file storage for model artifacts
  - Add file upload/download endpoints
  - Create storage abstraction layer
  - Handle different model formats (pickle, joblib, ONNX)

  Iteration 6: Model Lifecycle
  - Add model status management (draft, staging, production)
  - Implement model promotion workflow
  - Add model deregistration functionality
  - Create audit logging

  Phase 4: Enhanced Features (Iteration 7-8)

  Iteration 7: Model Comparison & Metrics
  - Add model performance metrics storage
  - Implement basic model comparison features
  - Create metrics visualization endpoints
  - Add model evaluation tracking

  Iteration 8: Integration & Testing
  - Add comprehensive test suite
  - Implement integration tests with mock ML models
  - Create sample ML model training scripts
  - Add Docker containerization
