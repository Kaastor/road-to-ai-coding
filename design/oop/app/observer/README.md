# Observer Pattern Implementation

A comprehensive implementation of the Observer design pattern for a stock market simulator with thread-safe operations and concurrent updates using Python's threading module.

## Features

- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Full thread safety for concurrent attach/detach operations and notifications
- **Stock Market Simulation**: Real-world scenario with stocks, traders, and analysts
- **Automatic Trading**: Traders automatically buy on price drops and sell on price increases
- **Market Analysis**: Analysts track statistics, volatility, and significant market movements
- **Event Notifications**: Market open/close events with comprehensive logging
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with proper exception management
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with thread safety validation

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Observer (Abstract)**: Base class defining the observer interface
2. **Subject**: Thread-safe subject class managing observers and notifications
3. **StockMarket**: Concrete subject implementing stock market functionality
4. **Trader**: Concrete observer implementing automated trading logic
5. **Analyst**: Concrete observer implementing market analysis and statistics

### Key Design Patterns Applied

- **Observer Pattern**: Loose coupling between market and participants
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has one clear responsibility
- **Open-Closed Principle**: Easy to extend with new observer types
- **Thread Safety**: Proper locking mechanisms for concurrent operations

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from app.observer import StockMarket, Trader, Analyst
from decimal import Decimal

# Create market and participants
market = StockMarket("NASDAQ")
trader = Trader("Alice", Decimal("10000"))
analyst = Analyst("Bob", "Technology")

# Attach observers
market.attach(trader)
market.attach(analyst)

# Add stocks and simulate trading
market.add_stock("AAPL", Decimal("150.00"))
market.open_market()
market.update_stock_price("AAPL", Decimal("147.00"), 25000)  # -2% triggers buys
market.close_market()
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
# Run comprehensive demonstration with threading
poetry run python run_observer_demo.py

# Run tests
poetry run python -m pytest app/tests/test_observer_pattern.py -v
```

## Thread Safety Features

- **RLock Usage**: Reentrant locks prevent deadlocks in nested operations
- **Atomic Operations**: Observer list modifications are atomic
- **Safe Notifications**: Observers notified outside critical sections
- **Exception Isolation**: Observer failures don't affect other observers
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple threads can safely operate simultaneously

## Trading Logic

### Trader Behavior

- **Buy Triggers**: Price drops ≥ 2% trigger purchase orders
- **Sell Triggers**: Price increases ≥ 3% trigger sale orders  
- **Position Limits**: Maximum 100 shares per stock
- **Cash Management**: Automatic cash and portfolio management

### Analyst Behavior

- **Price Tracking**: Maintains complete price history
- **Volatility Analysis**: Detects high volatility patterns
- **Significant Movements**: Alerts on ≥5% price changes
- **Statistical Reports**: Daily market analysis summaries

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:

- Observer interface compliance
- Subject attach/detach operations  
- Thread-safe concurrent operations
- Stock market functionality
- Trader automated trading logic
- Analyst statistical analysis
- Integration scenarios
- Error handling and edge cases

Run tests with: `poetry run python -m pytest app/tests/test_observer_pattern.py -v`

## Logging

All components include structured logging with appropriate levels:

- **INFO**: Normal operations (trades, price updates, market events)
- **WARNING**: Significant market movements, high volatility alerts
- **ERROR**: Exception handling, failed notifications
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information

## Extensibility

Easy to extend with new observer types:

```python
class NewsReporter(Observer):
    def update(self, subject, *args, **kwargs):
        # Implement news reporting logic
        pass
```

The thread-safe architecture ensures new observers integrate seamlessly with existing concurrent operations.
