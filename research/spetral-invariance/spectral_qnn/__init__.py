"""
Spectral Invariance of Quantum Neural Networks

This package implements the theoretical findings from:
"Spectral Invariance and Maximality Properties of the Frequency Spectrum of Quantum Neural Networks"

PennyLane-based implementation focusing on:
- QNN frequency spectrum calculation and analysis
- Spectral invariance under area-preserving transformations  
- Maximality conditions for 2D and arbitrary dimensional sub-generators
